The N puzzle is a game invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s. It is played
on an N-by-N grid with  `N^2 - 1`  tiles labeled 1 through N-1 and a blank square. The goal is to
rearrange the tiles so that they are in order. Players are permitted to slide one of the available
tiles horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally) into the blank square. This is a program that solves the puzzle automatically. It will be capable of
solving the puzzle for N=3, but also for N=4, N=5, and N=6. It implements
two search strategies: blind search and informed search.
